Once I found a 50+ square I would focus on squares near this one trying to find the highest square in the area. Once I'd explored the area I'd settle on what I thought was the highest square in that area and stay there. If the highest square was 60+ then I was happy to keep on that square, although only if I was sure I'd searched the entire surrounding squares for anything higher. If the squares were 70+ then I'd usually be able to search for one nearby that was 80+, and once I'd found an 80+ square I usually only searched one or two neighbouring squares before settling on one.","My strategy was only slightly different on group games. I'd use my teammates squares as guidance for my initial guesses. If one of them found a 50+ square then I'd usually search in that area for my own 50+ squares. Once I'd found a high square for myself I usually followed that trail, looking for any higher squares nearby, instead of looking at my teammates squares. However I was finding, or settling on squares that were 60-69 then I'd still look at my teammates grids to see if they found any 70+ squares, in which case I would have searched that area. This only happened once so for the most part my teammates were more useful at the start of the round.","No problems, instructions were easy to follow and I was motivated to score as high as possible.","2023-7-20","45","I-S","iypqQFP3VDyFTFpMAAAT",1
