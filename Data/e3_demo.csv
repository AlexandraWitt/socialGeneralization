Overall it was very engaging though. "

This took a few rounds. I decided that if the number was 40+ I would click the boxes around that square. If it was lower than 40 I looked at the other players' grids (although, I didn't have time to realise patterns) or clicked a box further away from the area I had been clicking in.","Fun game, I would play again. The bonuses were motivation to click as many boxes as possible per round. Thanks!"
